During the semester you will be working __in groups__ on __three mini projects__, shortly described as 
- [Web Services](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-si/blob/master/docs/MiniProjects/GP1.pdf), 
- [Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-si/blob/master/docs/MiniProjects/GP2.pdf), and 
- [Microservices Architecture](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019fall-si/blob/master/docs/MiniProjects/GP3.pdf).

All projects consist of design and development of a small software application, which illustrates a practical implementation of the system integration concepts, discussed in class.<br><br>
There is no expectation for submition of a written report, related to the project. Instead, a _public presentation_ of the solutions to the class, where _each team member_ participates, is required.
