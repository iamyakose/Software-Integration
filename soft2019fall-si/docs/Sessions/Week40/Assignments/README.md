# Research
This week we start diving into the second stream of our course content: business considerations of system integration at enterprises.
<br><br>As nowadays almost every business is an IT business, and businesses are the typical consumers of our software products, it is worth understanding the language, knowing the procedures, being able to communicate and integrate technologies inside the modern enterprises.
<br><br>You will learn about business process modeling and automation, workflow and rule engines, enterprise architectures and middleware, enterprise integration patters, and will practice various implementations of the integration techniques, you have already become familiar with.
<br><br>__For a quick start, please, browse Internet to search for information about Business Process Management (BPM) and BPM software.__
<br><br>You will find numerous software tools for management and automation, see for example [https://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/open-source-free-bpm-tools/](https://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/open-source-free-bpm-tools/)
or [https://www.softwaresuggest.com/us/bpm-business-process-management-software](https://www.softwaresuggest.com/us/bpm-business-process-management-software). <br>Some of these tools are meant for non-developers (low-code platforms), while others are used for facilitating the communication between the developers and business users and involve coding. 
1.	Be able to _name some products_ and some _criteria for comparing_ them.
2.	Instead of focusing on the differences between the products, get acquainted with the standard, which most of them share in following: [BPMN 2.0.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation)
3.	Download the poster from http://www.bpmb.de/images/BPMN2_0_Poster_EN.pdf and try to learn from it _what a BPMN diagram is_ and _what is its role_. You will be able to experience it in the next sessions.
