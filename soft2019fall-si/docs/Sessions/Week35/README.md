This folder contains resources related to the System Integration topics, discussed during the first semester week.	
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Agenda</h3>
<ul>
	<li>System Integration as a course at PBA</li>

		<li>tightly coupled and loosely coupled systems</li>
		<li>synchronous and asynchronous integration</li>
	</ul>
	<li>To get familiar with standardisation in system integration</li>
	<li>To get programming practice in developing P2P integration using networking protocols</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Homework Assignments <a href="https://app.peergrade.io/teacher/courses/cad8c537-e32d-4552-b083-27aa02dfe9e6/assignments"> (Peergrade) </a> </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Reading Task<br>
		Read The Open Group Service Integration Maturity Model (OSIMM) Version 2 (http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/osimmv2/) and answer the following questions:
		<ol>
			<li>How many maturity levels are defined by the standard?</li>
			<li>Which are the maturity dimensions, used as indicators for assessment of the maturity levels?</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Programming Tasks</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Task1 <br>
	Mission: Create an application to help a user to make money transactions between her computer and the server of the bank<p>
		1.Create a Client application, which <p>
		- opens connection to a server with a specific IP address and port<p>
		- reads data from the user: account number and (+ or -) amount of money<p>
		- sends the data to the Server<p>
		2.Create Server application that<p>
		- defines initial amount of money in the userâ€™s account<p>
		- opens connection at the specific port and accepts to listen to the client<p>
		- reads the request of the client and processes it:<p>
		= if the user wants to make savings (+), add the input amount to the current amount<p>
		= if the user wants to withdraw money (-), checks the availability, and then either subtracts the input amount from the current amount or prints a warning message<p>
		- returns a response<p>
		3.Run and test both applications on the same and on two different computers
	<li>Task2 <br>
		This assignment extends the Session 1 Project 2: Message Encoder.<p>
		You can choose to solve it and upload the solution in addition to or instead of the Bank Service assignment.<p>
		Here is the task:<p>
		In reality, servers often have to serve multiple clients at the same time.<p>
		Modify the demo program, provided by the instructor, in such a way so then the server would be able to listen to more than one clients at the same time.<p>
		Hint: Program running multiple threads.			
	<li>Task3 <br>
		This assignment extends the Session 1 Project 3: Capital Echo<p>
		You can choose to solve it and upload the solution in addition to or instead of the Bank Service assignment.<p>
		Here is the task:<p>
		UDP protocol provides faster transmission of messages, and therefore is a preferable for transmitting large, binary and video-streaming data.<p>
		Modify the demo program, provided by the instructor in such a way,, so it can be applied for sending and receiving image data from a binary file.<p>
		Hint: Replace the input stream with a more appropriate one.
