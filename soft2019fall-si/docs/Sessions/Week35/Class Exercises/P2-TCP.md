## Project 2: Message Encoder
This project illustrates control over the communication and exchange of text messages between a client and a server using TCP protocol over Sockets and endpoints. <br>

Server opens a server socket __ServerSocket__ on a specified port __IP:port__ and starts listening on it.<br>

When ServerSocket detects an incoming connection, it will __accept()__ it and create a new __Socket__ instance to facilitate the communication to the client, sending the request.<br>

The procedure is:
1. Server opens one of its ports, preferably with a number > 1024, for example 6666, and creates a socket for it
2. Server declares that is ready to listen and accept requests
3. If a message from a Client comes on this port, Server processes it, by reverting the text.
4. Server keeps doing (3), until a 'stop' command comes from the Client

         * 2. Listen for a connection from the client and accept it. 
         *    This results in a client socket, created on the server, for the connection.
         * 3. Read data from the client via an InputStream obtained from the client socket
         * 4. Send data to the client via the client socketâ€™s OutputStream.
         * 5. Close the connection with the client.
         * 
         * The steps 3 and 4 can be repeated many times depending on the protocol agreed between the server and the client.

The __Client__makes a request to the Server and prints its response on the console.<br>
As a prerequisite, the Client needs to know server's identification, __IP:port__.

Alternatively, it will pass _null_ to the method __getByName()__that can produce a _Local Loopback_ IP address, which we can use for testing the communication between the Client and the Server on one machine out of a network. <br>

Once established, the communication between the Client and the Server stays opened, until the Client stops it explicitely.

# Homework Task
In the reality, servers often have to serve multiple clients at the same time.<br>

Modify the program above, so then server would be able to listen to more than one clients in parralel, running  multiple threads.
