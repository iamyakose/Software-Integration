# Reading Assignment (â‰ˆ 3h)

One of the signature readings in this area is the book of Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf _"Enterprise Integration Patterns
Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions"_.<br>

Your task is to read [Chapter 3: Messaging Systems](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns_HohpeWoolf_ch03.pdf) and to create a [glossary](https://www.google.com/search?q=glossary&oq=glossary&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2261j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of __at least ten terms__, related to System Integration, which you find essential.
